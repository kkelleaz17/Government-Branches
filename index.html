                <h1>Executive Branch</h1>
                <p>The <strong>Executive Branch</strong>, headed by the President of the United States, is responsible for enforcing and implementing laws. It includes various departments and agencies that handle specific aspects of governance, such as defense, diplomacy, and law enforcement.</p>

            <div>
                <h1>Legislative Branch</h1>
                <p>The <strong>Legislative Branch</strong>, consisting of the Congress, plays a crucial role in the lawmaking process. The Congress is bicameral, comprising the <strong>Senate</strong> and the <strong>House of Representatives</strong>. Senators and Representatives draft, debate, and vote on proposed legislation, representing the interests of the American people.</p>
            </div>
        
            <div>
                <h1>Judicial Branch</h1>
                <p>The <strong>Judicial Branch</strong>, led by the Supreme Court, interprets laws and ensures their constitutionality. Federal courts across the country handle cases that may involve constitutional questions or disputes between parties. The decisions made by the courts set legal precedents that guide future interpretations of the law.</p>

        <article id="FavBranche">
            <h1>My Favorite</h1>
            <p>I have a strong preference for the Executive Branch for several reasons. Firstly, 
                its decisive leadership during crises provides a sense of stability and direction, 
                which I find reassuring. Secondly, the branch's role in translating policies into action 
                showcases a hands-on approach to governance, ensuring that positive changes are not just discussed 
                but actively implemented for the benefit of the people. Lastly, the Executive's involvement in global 
                representation and diplomacy resonates with me, emphasizing the importance of a strong and adept leader in 
                international affairs, 
                contributing to positive relationships and elevating our nation's standing in the world.</p>
